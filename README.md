# VMdetection
vm_detection project allows you to run various checks which will detect whether the system is virtual machine or not. 
This program can be executed on windows platform only. Checks applied will only be able to detect VMware hosted vm. But this can be also extended to work with virtualbox. 
I have tested this program with VMware 15 and Windows 10 VM.
